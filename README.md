# stock-prediciton-ai
This is a really beginner-level stock prediciton AI using linear regression only until 2023 november 2nd

In this project I made a really dumbed down version of a stock prediction bot. I used linear regression to train a model on data I got from an API that served me with the stock prices of Google (ticker symbol GOOG) from 2019 March 18th to 2023 November 2nd.

Instruction on how to properly run the program:

1: Run the apiimport.py file
2: Replace with the desired .csv file in the jupyter file (2nd cell 1st line)
3: Let the jupyter cells run
